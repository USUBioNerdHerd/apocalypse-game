    // Austin's notes
    
    
    // Question Order--First Half
    // Housing is needed (“People are coming”)
    // Cut down forest ⇒ Fragmentation
    // Increase city density ⇒ Urban quality goes down (river pollution, etc.)

    // Power is needed (“Our infrastructure can’t cope”)
    // Nuclear ⇒ Waste storage, decreased land quality
    // Coal ⇒ Decreased air quality
    // Wind turbines ⇒ Decreased birds, decreased recreation

    // Food is needed (“Feed us”)
    // Fish farm ⇒ bad river--instantly
    // Livestock ⇒ leaching

    // Recreation is needed (“Now we need fun”)
    // Forest ⇒ less farms, less food
    // Swim in the river ⇒ Worse river quality
    // Denser city ⇒ Pollution

    // Question Order--Second Half
    // Too little/poor quality forest
    // Street trees/ urban forests  ⇒ better urban environment
    // Outreach, to use what you have  ⇒ greater health, greater money

    // Too little/poor quality farmland
    // Crop cycling  ⇒ Greater biodiversity (food, birds, insects)
    // Distributed agriculture  ⇒ urban, recreational, greater food

    // Poor air quality
    // Street tree & urban forests ⇒ better urban pollution (grime)
    // Outreach to use what you have ⇒ healthier & money

    // Bad river quality
    // Build filtration plant  ⇒ fixes river quality, but costs more money
    // Wetland expansion  ⇒ greater birds, greater recreation
