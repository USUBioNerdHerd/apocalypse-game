# Summary
Around the world, human activities are resulting in unprecedented environmental change. Legislators and resource managers are often presented with the difficult challenge of addressing human needs while minimizing environmental impact. With each resource use decision, it is important to consider the big picture of environmental change, how our impacts compound over time, and to what extent can we undo damage that is already done. With these challenges in mind, we have produced a game that simulates the environmental impacts of resource and land use decisions. 

Resource Use Simulation of the Environment (RUSE) is a game that asks the user to respond to eight crises, ranging from energy and housing to water and air quality needs, by choosing among prescribed management options. It then simulates the environmental impacts of each action taken and presents the user with the next challenge and corresponding options. Because the impacts compound across the landscape with each successive action, the user can see how environmental impacts accumulate and whether they can be undone. While RUSE focuses on general needs with corresponding options and impacts, we recognize that human needs and solutions are often highly place-based; therefore, our group has also generated resources with which instructors and students can make their own games by replacing the current scenarios with local needs and response options. 
# Would be great to pump this up with some real NERD SPEAK :P (for a diverse, non-specialist audience)

RUSE was designed to provide a visual decision-making framework in which students can explore the difficulty of balancing human needs use with environmental health; it includes documentation for customizing the game as a resource for educators and students.
